# An Example Isomorphic Application

## Welcome To The Demo

PedalPulse is an example isomorphic application that demonstrates a high performance app that uses multiple services and a quality process.

The page content and navigation come from a backend service.

It uses Facebook's [React](http://reactjs.com) and Yahoo's [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io).

This example also showcases quality automation using cloud services. Checkout the [repo](https://github.com/localnerve/flux-react-example) for the full details.

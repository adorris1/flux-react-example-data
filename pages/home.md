## Welcome To The Demo

This is an isomorphic web app that demonstrates high performance and multiple backing services.

This example is data-driven. All the content you see, including navigation, come from a [backend data service](https://github.com/localnerve/flux-react-example-data).

The application uses Facebook's [React](http://reactjs.com) and Yahoo's [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io).

The [code](https://github.com/localnerve/flux-react-example) showcases quality automation using CI/CD cloud services.
